        I am full of curiosty and interest in this aspect,and I am studing hard.

         Watching movies can amuse me and I can learn something interesting
          from them, while traveling can make me know the world better. 
          One of my favorite movies is Inception, it makes my imagination rich.

           to improve myself.</p>
